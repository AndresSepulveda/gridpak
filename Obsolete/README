New in 5.4:

Fixed up stretch to use with the netCDF file. It now reads one grid
file and writes another one. In order to use it, you need to edit
gridparam.h and add 1 to L, you need to edit gridid.h to make
grid1_file point to the old file and gridfile point to the new file,
and you need to edit opencdf.F to cut out the dimension checks on L and
LP.

Changed mapbath to use the netCDF bathymetry files.

See ../proj for double precision Coast and Tolat.

New in 5.3:

Added KEEP_SHALLOW option - see the manual.
Fixed a few bugs.
Took out MUD2 option and added sepeli to gridpak, so we no longer need
to link to spemlib.a.

New in 5.2:

Updated to netcdf 3.4 interface - change Fortran names to lower case.

New in 5.1:

Updated to netcdf 3.3 interface - just to try it out.

New in 5.0:

Here is the new, improved gridpak.  The following programs now all
write to the same netCDF file which gets created by either grid or
sqgrid.  A variable called hraw is used for the working bathymetry.
hraw has an unlimited dimension so that a number of different
smoothing options can be tried.

bathtub now reads a netCDF version of the entire etopo5 file.  We
are assuming that you are using a machine with sufficient memory for
this.

grid:      computes an orthogonal boundary fitted grid by conformal mapping
           reads from stdin
	   creates the netCDF grid file and
           writes pm,pn,x_psi,y_psi,x_rho,y_rho,x_u,y_u,x_v,y_v
sqgrid:    computes a rectangular grid
           reads from stdin
	   creates the netCDF grid file and
           writes pm,pn,x_psi,y_psi,x_rho,y_rho,x_u,y_u,x_v,y_v
tolat:     converts the cartesian grid coordinates back to lat,lon
bathtub:   inTerpolate User Bathymetry from etopo5 at lan,lon points
bathsoap:  Smooth Over All Points using a Shapiro filter
bathsuds:  User Defined Smoothing using a modified Shapiro filter
sphere:    recalculates pm,pn and f if required on a sphere, writes
	   the requested version of hraw into the h variable in
	   the netCDF file.
mask_fill: read the rho mask and write out consistent u,v,psi masks.
mapbath:   read the bathymetry file (etopo5) and find one contour,
           write out the lat, lon values of that contour to fort.58.
stretch:   reads a grid file and writes a new one which has L=L+1
           and is periodic (assuming the original one matched at the edges


These programs have not been updated:

coast:     converts lat,lon points to x,y coordinates
           reads from stdin
