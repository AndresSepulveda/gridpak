This is grid generation software used for building ROMS grids the
old-fashioned way. The manual (which needs updating) is here:
    https://marine.rutgers.edu/po/tools/gridpak/grid_manual.ps.gz

You must have consistent versions of a Fortran compiler, the NCL package
and the NetCDF library.

The current distribution gets rid of the sqgrid executable in favor of
grid knowing how to gracefully handle rectangular grids.

I'm distributing it with several test cases, each with their own Include
directory. Point to the appropriate Include directory in the Makefile. The
grid input file(s) are in the current directory. The domains here:

* Benguela: a rotated rectangular grid
* Bering Strait: a non-rotated rectangle
* Island: a small very curvilinear toy domain between Iceland and Greenland
* S_Africa: a U-shaped domain around southern Africa using xpots on side 2:
    xpots -N 1601 -F fort.42
* Supercritical: an idealized test problem in x,y space with a flat bottom

Issues:

* There's something wrong with the Makefile dependencies and I don't know
  why - trying to do everything the ROMS way (and the ROMS way works). Best
  to do "make clean" between builds if anything at all goes wrong.

* I'd put xpots out on github if it was working... The graphics now show
  up for me all in black, so it's quite tricky to use.

Notes on Benguela bathymetry:
      hmin=50, 300 bathsuds, 1 bathsoap => 0.33 rmax
